        <hr/>
        <p class="lead">This project is a simple example of how to use Python, Postgresql with Timescaledb, Flask & Docker to create a simple data pipeline.</p>
        <p class="lead">The data is collected from Binance API and stored in a Postgresql database in tables indexed with Timescaledb . </p>
        <p class="lead">With the data stored in Postgresql, we can use advanced queries with timescaledb unique features, which helps creating a simple dashboard using Flask.</p>

        <h2 class="display-4">What could be improved for scaling? </h2>

        <p class="lead">The data pipeline could be improved by using Kafka for handling the realtime data. </p>
        <p class="lead">Kafka could sink the data into Apache spark. </p>
        <p class="lead">Apache Spark could persist the data into PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension. </p>
        <p class="lead">With our data persisted, we could then create the dashboards using Grafana, Superset or other tools . </p>
